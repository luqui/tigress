This is the latest whack at the Sequent code organization system.  To start it
up, just

    % cabal configure
    % cabal build
    % ./dist/build/tigress/tigress

Once you're there, you get a prompt

    > 

Right now the object language is Javascript.  So you can define Javascript
objects

    > id = function(x) { return x }

Or if you prefer to use an editor

    > define id

And then use them

    > eval id(42)
    42

And you can make abstractions

    > assert identity id

Check out

    > env

Which shows you your current concrete environment.

Once you are done with a concrete environment, you can discharge it

    > clear

And then use the abstractions

    > assume identity ident
    > eval ident(4)

More later.
